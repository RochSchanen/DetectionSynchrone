- Create repository "https://github.com/RochSchanen/DetectionSynchrone"
- add notes.txt and logfile.txt
- add test files for Alchitry Cu device.
- these files compile with IceCube2 software provided by lattice.
- The programmer used can be the AlchitryCu loader or the IceStorm loader.

IceCube2 configuration for the Alchitry Board
	- Device familly "iCE40"
	- Device "HX8K"
	- Device Package "CB132"
	- IOBank Voltage "3.3" volts for all banks
	- add files:
		latticeBlink.vhd : VHDL language version
		latticeBlink.pcf : pins constraints
		latticeBlink.sdc : timer constraints
	- note: works alternatively with the Verilog language version too: "latticeBlink.v".
	- All files are generated in the "latticeBlink" sub folder (not in repository).
	- The binary file "latticeBlink_bitmap.bin" is found in the "latticeBlink/latticeBlink_Implmnt/sbt/outputs/bitmap" folder.

- add "latticeBlink_bitmap.bin" to the repo to check the programmers when debugging.
- programming checked:

	>iceprog latticeBlink_bitmap.bin 
	init..
	cdone: high
	reset..
	cdone: low
	flash ID: 0xEF 0x40 0x16 0x00
	file size: 135179
	erase 64kB sector at 0x000000..
	erase 64kB sector at 0x010000..
	erase 64kB sector at 0x020000..
	programming..
	reading..
	VERIFY OK
	cdone: high
	Bye.

- led0 blinks at typical frequency of 100MHZ/2^26 ~ 1HZ.
- add files:
	AlchitryCu_UART.pcf
	AlchitryCu_UART.sdc
	AlchitryCu_UART.vhd
	AlchitryCu_UART.py
- compile and program:
	AlchitryCu_UART_bitmap.bin
- add "AlchitryCu_UART_bitmap.bin" to the project for later tests
- when "AlchitryCu_UART_bitmap.bin" is loaded to the device,
run the python test program "AlchitryCu_UART.py" to check the echo
response of the device through UART port B ("ttyUSB1")
- note: "ttyUSB0" is used by the programmer to store the binary file
in the eprom that configures the FPGA (AlchitryCu specific):

	>./AlchitryCu_UART.py

	|hello 1
	|
	|hello 2
	|
	|hello 3
	|
	|hello 4
	|

- So far, so good.

- write UART receiver architecture
- data echoed properly but leds shows the same value independently from the character send: value is 8+2 = 10. So the transmission is at least partially working. The outcome depends on the transmission frequency if the UART clock is slowed down to half the frequency.

- Solder pins to the Alchitry Br to connect the agilent digital signals cable to monitor up to 16 channels at high-speed (2Gbit/s).
- 100 MHz Clock, UART Tx, UART Rx, one Gnd, and eight single ended I/O pins are now accessible for measurements an testing. more will probably be required.
- Correct the transmission issue which causes the leds to show permanently the integer 10 by preventing the serial port from sending the terminal string Carriage return (CR=13) followed by a line-feed (LF=10).
- the UART receive VHDL code works (Add data valid later).
- add binary string to the python script command line for testing.
- converts files tabs to spaces
