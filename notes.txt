	language
		
		VHDL
		
		Verilog

	compilers and programers
	
		Quartus II
			for programming the DE0-Nano.
			Verilog, VHDL and Graphic.
			super heavy.
			modelSim simulator.

		Vivado Suite
			for programming the ARTY-S7
			Verilog, VHDL and Graphic.
			super heavy.
			modelSim simulator.

		IceStorm (Yosys, nextprn, icestorm)
			for programing iCE40 devices.
			with loader.
			Open source.
			but Only Verilog.
			separate simulator required.

		IceCube2
			for programing iCE40 devices.
			VHDL, Verilog.
			no simulator.

		Alchitry labs
			front end for vivado, icecube, icestorm.
			one of these sythesizer needs to be installed at least.
			for programing alchitry Au (Xilinx) or Cu (lattice).
			It has its own programming language "Lucid"
			Only verilog if used with icestorm.
			no loader.

		Alchitry loader
			A loader for loading to alchitry device.
			One can use the icestorm programmer to
			upload a file created by icecube.

	simulators

		LogicCircuit
			"http://www.logiccircuit.org/"
			for testing concept.
			Light.
			Clean png exports.

		GHDL
			for simulating VHDL programs.

		for Verilog
			check: "https://github.com/cambridgehackers/open-src-cvc"
			check: "http://iverilog.icarus.com/"

	Other:

		GTKwave (signals viewer)
			"http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/"
			"https://github.com/gtkwave"
			for displaying simulated output files.
