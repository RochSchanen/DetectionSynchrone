    basics

        before and after the rising edge of the clock
        data must be set and steady ts seconds before
        the rising edge and th seconds after.
        ts is known as the Setup time.
        th is known as the Hold time.

    language
        
        VHDL
        
        Verilog

    compilers and programers
    
        Quartus II
            for programming the DE0-Nano.
            Verilog, VHDL and Graphic.
            super heavy.
            modelSim simulator.

        Vivado Suite
            for programming the ARTY-S7
            Verilog, VHDL and Graphic.
            super heavy.
            modelSim simulator.

        IceStorm (Yosys, nextprn, icestorm)
            for programing iCE40 devices.
            with loader.
            Open source.
            but Only Verilog.
            separate simulator required.

        IceCube2
            for programing iCE40 devices.
            VHDL, Verilog.
            no simulator.

        Alchitry labs
            front end for vivado, icecube, icestorm.
            one of these sythesizer needs to be installed at least.
            for programing alchitry Au (Xilinx) or Cu (lattice).
            It has its own programming language "Lucid"
            Only verilog if used with icestorm.
            no loader.

        Alchitry loader
            A loader for loading to alchitry device.
            One can use the icestorm programmer to
            upload a file created by icecube.

    simulators

        LogicCircuit
            "http://www.logiccircuit.org/"
            for testing concept.
            Light.
            Clean png exports.

        GHDL
            for simulating VHDL programs.
            for testing at Register-transfer level (RTL)
            Light.
            Clean VCD export files (use gtkwave for display).

    Other:

        GTKwave (signals viewer)
            "http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/"
            "https://github.com/gtkwave"
            for displaying simulated output files.
